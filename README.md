# Lego Data Science
 
This Lego notebook explores aspects such as LEGO set complexity over time, themes, or the number of pieces per set, using Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib or seaborn for visualization.

1. We used pandas to load LEGO datasets into DataFrame objects, enabling efficient data manipulation and analysis within the Python environment.
2. The notebook likely includes data cleaning operations, such as handling missing values and filtering the data, to prepare it for analysis, utilizing pandas' powerful data wrangling capabilities.
3. We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with pandas, using descriptive statistics and aggregation functions to understand the distributions, trends, and patterns in the LEGO data.
4. The analysis might have included merging or joining multiple LEGO datasets to create comprehensive views and perform more in-depth analyses on themes, sets, and their evolution over time.
5. Visualization tasks, though not directly mentioned, were probably supported by pandas' integration with plotting libraries, allowing us to create insightful charts and graphs based on the LEGO datasets.
